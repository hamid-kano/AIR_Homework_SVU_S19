Is Wikipedia censored?
Wikipedia uses the minimum of censorship. Generally, only gratuitous explicit (pornographic) images are removed. The community of Wikipedia editors determine what text and images are displayed, so there may be material that offends some people. There may be those who are offended, shocked or disgusted by medical images, nudity, religious imagery and controversial images.
