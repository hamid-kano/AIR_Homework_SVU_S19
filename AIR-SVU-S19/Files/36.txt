Why do I see commercial ads at Wikipedia?
Wikipedia is funded by donations and does not display advertisements on any of our articles. If you see ads, then something at your end or in between must be placing them. Some browser extensions or plugins can do it, for example, Codec-C, Genieo, and InfoAtoms. Codec-C is marketed as needed to play videos. Your computer may be infected with malware – consider using anti-malware software. You may be viewing a mirror or fork hosted by someone else, not the Wikimedia Foundation, and that host may have added advertising and perhaps other content – verify that the whole URL in your browser address bar is for this website and not a mirror or fork, and if you're not sure then copy this address and find the content you want from it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page. There may also have been inappropriate user edits to Wikipedia which look like an ad or even claim to be an ad, but such edits are against our policies and not real paid ads.
